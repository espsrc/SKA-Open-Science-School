# Overview of package managers and containers for scientific software

Package managers and containers are essential tools for managing scientific software dependencies and creating reproducible environments for software development and analysis.

Package managers such as *pip*, *conda (mamba, miniconda, etc)*, and *apt-get* (as many others) are used to install, update, and manage software packages and their dependencies. They ensure that the necessary libraries and tools are installed and configured correctly, and can help avoid version conflicts or other compatibility issues.

Containers, on the other hand, are complete and portable environments that include not only the software packages and their dependencies but also the necessary libraries and operating system. Containers can be easily shared and run on different platforms, ensuring that the software works the same way regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

Using package managers and containers can provide several benefits, such as:

- Reproducibility: By capturing the software and its dependencies, it's easier to recreate the environment and reproduce the same results.
- Portability: Containers can be easily shared and run on different platforms, ensuring that the software works the same way regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
- Isolation: Containers and virtual environments can help isolate the software and its dependencies from other software on the system, reducing the risk of conflicts or compatibility issues.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of package managers

- Package managers can automate the installation and management of software dependencies, making it easier to reproduce computational environments, can ensure that software dependencies are compatible with each other and with the operating system, reducing the risk of conflicts or incompatibilities and can provide a centralized repository of software packages, making it easier to discover and install new software.

- Package managers may have limited support for specific operating systems or software packages and thet may require manual configuration or troubleshooting to resolve conflicts or incompatibilities.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of containers
 
- Containers can encapsulate an entire computational environment, including the operating system, software dependencies, and data, making it easier to reproduce computational environments, they can provide a standardized and portable way to share computational environments across different systems and platforms and it can provide a secure and isolated environment for running software, reducing the risk of conflicts or security vulnerabilities.

- Containers can have a larger overhead in terms of disk space and computational resources compared to other methods of software distribution and installation, they may require additional configuration or setup to interact with other systems or services outside of the container environment, and they have limited support for specific operating systems or architectures, depending on the containerization technology used.
