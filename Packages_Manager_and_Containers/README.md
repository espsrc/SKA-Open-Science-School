:rocket: In this workshop, you will learn about the role of open source package managers üë©‚Äçüíª and containers üì¶ in building reproducible scientific software. 

:satellite: We will begin with an introduction to Open Science and the importance of software reproducibility in scientific research, and then move on to explore the basics of package managers and containers. In this workshop we will cover topics such as creating and managing virtual environments, installing packages from various sources, and building and running Docker and Singulariy containers. We will also discuss best practices for creating and sharing Docker images for scientific software.

:mag: Throughout the workshop, you will have the opportunity to practice using these :wrench: tools through hands-on exercises. By the end of the workshop, you will have gained a solid understanding of how package managers and containers can help overcome challenges in scientific software development and promote reproducibility, as well as practical experience using these tools in real-world scenarios. 

:bulb: Whether you are a researcher, software developer, or data scientist, this workshop will provide you with valuable skills for building reproducible and reliable scientific software to deliver to the science community.

## 1. Introduction to software reproducibility

This section will provide an introduction to the importance of reproducibility of the software research. Students will learn about the challenges faced by researchers in ensuring reproducibility, and the role that software dependencies and technical factors can play in these challenges.
